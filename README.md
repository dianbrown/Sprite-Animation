# Sprite Animation Playground

A playground for experimenting with **sprite-based animations for websites** using **JavaScript, CSS, and other animation techniques**. 

This repository is intended for testing and learning how to:  
- Animate **sprite sheets** using **CSS keyframes and steps()**  
- Animate sprites in **JavaScript with `<canvas>`**  
- Integrate **custom Aseprite exports** for website animations  
- Explore **different libraries or technologies** to make characters walk, run, and perform other actions on websites  

---

## Features
- üåü **CSS Sprite Animations** (simple and lightweight)  
- üéÆ **JavaScript Canvas Animations** (for more dynamic control)  
- ‚ö° **Experiment with Libraries** like **GSAP** or **Phaser** or **PIXIEjs** in the future  
- üñåÔ∏è **Custom sprite sheets** exported from **Aseprite**  

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 & CSS3** (for lightweight sprite animation)
- **JavaScript (Canvas API)** for game-like animations
- **Aseprite** (for creating and exporting sprite sheets)
- **PIXIEjs** (for handling all physics and better animations)

---

## Planned Experiments
- ‚úÖ Basic CSS `steps()` sprite animation  
- ‚úÖ JavaScript canvas sprite walking left/right  
- ‚úÖ Flipping & directional control for sprites  
- ‚úÖ GSAP/Phaser.js/PIXIEjs sprite animation tests
- ‚è≥ Full physics
- ‚è≥ More animations per sprite
- ‚è≥ Interactive sprites
- ‚è≥ Final implementation for demo website

This project is for **personal learning and experimentation**.  
Feel free to fork and experiment with your own sprite animations!
