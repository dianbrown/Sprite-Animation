# Sprite Animation Playground

A playground for experimenting with **sprite-based animations for websites** using **JavaScript, CSS, and other animation techniques**.  

This repository is intended for testing and learning how to:  
- Animate **sprite sheets** using **CSS keyframes and steps()**  
- Animate sprites in **JavaScript with `<canvas>`**  
- Integrate **custom Aseprite exports** for website animations  
- Explore **different libraries or technologies** to make characters walk, run, and perform other actions on websites  

---

## Features
- 🌟 **CSS Sprite Animations** (simple and lightweight)  
- 🎮 **JavaScript Canvas Animations** (for more dynamic control)  
- ⚡ **Experiment with Libraries** like **GSAP** or **Phaser** in the future  
- 🖌️ **Custom sprite sheets** exported from **Aseprite**  

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 & CSS3** (for lightweight sprite animation)
- **JavaScript (Canvas API)** for game-like animations
- **Aseprite** (for creating and exporting sprite sheets)

---

## Planned Experiments
- ✅ Basic CSS `steps()` sprite animation  
- ⏳ JavaScript canvas sprite walking left/right  
- ⏳ Flipping & directional control for sprites  
- ⏳ GSAP/Phaser.js sprite animation tests
